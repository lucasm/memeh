              <h2>Mission & Ownership</h2>
              <p>
                Aspiral is an open-source news aggregator providing trusted journalism without algorithms, independent, and completely
                ad-free. The project was founded by <strong>Lucas Maués</strong>, a Brazilian Software Engineer, and is maintained by the{' '}
                <strong>Open Source Community</strong> contributors and sponsors.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our mission is to foster a high-signal, low-noise information environment by curating the world’s most reputable sources in
                Technology, Business, Science, Culture, and Global Affairs.
              </p>
              <p>
                As a self-funded project, Aspiral ensures complete editorial independence from corporate or political interests. We
                prioritize clarity, transparency, and the user’s right to high-quality, unfiltered information.

              <h2>Trust Indicators</h2>
              <p>
                We are committed to the <strong>8 Trust Indicators</strong> established by <em>The Trust Project</em>. Unlike traditional
                aggregators, Aspiral strictly vets every source based on its track record of factual reporting and ethical accountability.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Source Validation:</strong> Every publication included (e.g., Reuters, AP, The Atlantic, BBC) is manually verified
                  for journalistic excellence.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Algorithm Transparency:</strong> Our curation logic favors primary sources and deep-dive journals. Finally, more
                  general news outlets. We don't have any other type of filter. We provide sources "as is", to avoid biasing the feed. We
                  don't use algorithms that may prioritize engagement over quality.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Content Integrity:</strong> We do not modify original headlines or alter editorial contexts. Users are always
                  redirected to the original source.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Pluralism by Design:</strong> Our grid-based interface prevents "top news" bias. Sources are positioned to act as
                  counterbalances to one another, ensuring a balanced spectrum of viewpoints.
                </li>
