            <h2>Mission & Ownership</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>Aspiral</strong> is a tiny Web Application of news headlines of trusted journalism, without algorithms, independent
              and ad-free.The project was founded by <strong>Lucas Maués</strong>, a Software Engineer from Brazil, and operated by the{' '}
              <strong>open source community</strong>. Our mission is to provide a high-signal, low-noise information environment by curating
              the world’s most reputable sources in Technology, Business, Science, Culture, and Global Affairs.
            </p>
            <p>
              Aspiral is a self-funded project, ensuring complete editorial independence from corporate or political interests. We
              prioritize clarity, transparency, and the user’s right to high-quality information.
            </p>
            <h2>Trust Standards & Integrity</h2>
            <p>
              We are committed to the <strong>8 Trust Indicators</strong> established by <em>The Trust Project</em>. Unlike traditional
              aggregators, Aspiral strictly vets every source for its track record of factual reporting and ethical accountability.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Source Validation:</strong> Every publication in our App (e.g., Reuters, AP, The Atlantic, Nautilus) is manually
                verified for journalistic excellence.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Algorithm Transparency:</strong> Our curation logic favors primary sources and deep-dive journals. Finally, more
                general news outlets. We don't have any other type of filters. We provide sources "as is", to avoid biasing the feed with
                algorithms that may prioritize engagement over quality.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Content Integrity:</strong> We do not modify original headlines or alter the editorial context of the articles we
                show. We redirect users to the original source.
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>Democracy and Pluralism by Design:</strong> Every source is a counterbalance of another, to provide a balanced
                spectrum of viewpoints and prevent ideological echo chambers. The App was desgined to show feed in grid, like the old RSS
                readers, to avoid the "top news" bias of traditional aggregators. We don't have any "top news" section, to avoid privileging
                some sources over others.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Editorial Guidelines</h2>
            <p>
              Our selection process aims to provide a balanced spectrum of viewpoints to prevent ideological echo chambers. We prioritize:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Global news agencies for immediate, factual reporting.</li>
              <li>Analytical journals for deep economic, cultural, scientific, and sociological context.</li>
              <li>Niche publications focused on technology ethics, digital innovation and human rights.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Accountability & Corrections</h2>
            <p>
              We believe in the "Right to Correction." If you identify any source that fails to meet our quality standards or notice
